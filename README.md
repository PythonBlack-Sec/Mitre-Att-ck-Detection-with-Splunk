# Mitre Att&ck Detection with Splunk

Within our Github repository we have developed Splunk filters for a few of the common vulnerabilities within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. Within this repository we will be focusing on a list of vulnerabilities that span various columns of the framework.

For each vulnerabilitiy we will mention the Technique Description, Assumptions, Execution, Detection (Visibility, Filter/Correlation Rule)

Within each MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique we will express our interpretation of the technique description. This can be followed up with the Original Mitre description at: https://attack.mitre.org/ 

For further testing we have explored the use of redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/atomics github page for help with attack execution. This can be located at: https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/tree/master/atomics
